# raylib-lua-sol

[Lua](http://www.lua.org/) bindings for [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming, with [sol](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) (www.raylib.com)

*raylib-lua-sol* bindings are self-contained in a header-only file: [raylib-lua-sol.hpp](include/raylib-lua-sol.hpp). Just include that file
in your project to allow loading and execution of raylib code written in Lua and Sol.

*raylib-lua-sol* could be useful for prototyping, tools development, graphic applications, embedded systems and education.

Ready to learn? Check out the [code examples](examples)!

## Example

``` lua
local screenWidth = 800
local screenHeight = 450

InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, "raylib [core] example - basic window")

SetTargetFPS(60)

while not WindowShouldClose() do
    BeginDrawing()
        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE)
        DrawText("Congrats! You created your first window!", 190, 200, 20, LIGHTGRAY)
    EndDrawing()
end
CloseWindow()
```

## CLI

A [`raylib-lua-sol`](bin/raylib-lua-sol.cpp) CLI launcher is provided. This launcher allows you to run raylib lua programs from command line, or just with *drag & drop* of .lua files into *raylib-lua-sol.exe*.

Note that launcher can also be compiled for other platforms, just need to link with Lua, raylib and sol libraries. For more details, just check comments on sources.

``` bash
bin/raylib-lua-sol examples/core_basic_window.lua
```

## Prebuild On Windows

Require:

- C Compiler: MinGW([Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html),...) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).

## Prebuild On GNU Linux

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake
```

### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install libasound2-dev mesa-common-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev xorg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
```

### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXrandr-devel libXi-devel libXcursor-devel libXinerama-devel
```

## Build

*raylib-lua-sol* uses cmake as a primary development target. Would appreciate adding more project templates, however.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-lua-sol.git
cd raylib-lua-sol
git submodule update --init
cmake -B build .
cmake --build build --config Release
```

## Development

To run tests, use `make test`...

``` bash
cd build
make test
```
